# Name: Sum square difference
# Description: The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
#              1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
#              The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
#              (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
#              Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the
#              first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is
#              3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
#              Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the
#              first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
